The CSS code has an invalid or unexpected selector, such as using an invalid attribute selector or a selector that doesn't match any elements in the HTML. This may result in the styles not being applied as expected or cause unexpected behavior.  For instance:
```css
/*Invalid attribute selector*/
div[type="text"] { color: blue; }

/*Selector that doesn't match*/
#nonExistentElement { background-color: red; }
```
